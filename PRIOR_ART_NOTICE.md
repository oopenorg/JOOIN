# PRIOR ART NOTICE

This document is published to establish **technical prior art** for the JOOIN system.

By publicly documenting this modular construction concept, we aim to prevent any future patent claims that could limit its openness, reuse, or development.

This publication serves to:

- Protect the concept from restrictive intellectual property claims
- Declare the authorship and invention date
- Ensure the core principles of JOOIN remain accessible to all

No license is granted at this stage.  
This is not an open source release.  
All rights remain with the original authors until an open license is applied.
